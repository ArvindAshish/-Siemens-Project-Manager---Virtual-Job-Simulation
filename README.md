Siemens Project Manager Virtual Job Simulation – Completed Tasks
This repository contains my completed project work from the Project Manager Virtual Experience Program by Siemens hosted on Forage.

📌 Overview
The simulation offers a practical insight into the role of a project manager at Siemens, where I worked on the Metroville Urban Rail Expansion Project. This included defining KPIs for project success, stakeholder analysis, and managing project scope, timelines, and risks in a structured format.
